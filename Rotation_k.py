"""A sorted array A of n > 1 distinct integers has undergone
a rotation k positions to the LEFT, 1 â‰¤ k < n. For example, for 
A =[5, 7, 9, 2, 3] the value of k is 2 ,istead while for A = [9, 2, 3, 5, 7] it is 4.
Design an algorithm that, given the array A, returns the value in O(log n) time
by k.

 #### In Recursive mode, the simple Algorithmic Idea:
        ### I perform binary searches to find the minimum in time log(n)
        ### as the Array is sorted
        ### we can apply a binary search known to work in log n, always halving the input value, after return len(n)-i
        ### as it returns the number of moves
        ### B=[10,12,15,17,5,7,8,9] len(B)=8 k = 4 rotations
        ### k=len(B) - i rotations
